## Test environments
* ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS (travis-ci) and 14.04.5 LTS (local), R 3.3.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE:

* Maintainer: ‘Blake Seers <blake.seers@gmail.com>’
  This is the correct email address.

  Also, the possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION (CliFlo, Reefton, Zealand, and clifro) are all spelled correctly.

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD CHECK on macleish, the only downstream dependency of clifro, without any problems.
