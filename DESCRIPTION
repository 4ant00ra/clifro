Description: Minimise the hassle of downloading data from New Zealand's National
    Climate Database via CliFlo, and reading it into \R. The user can log in,
    choose the relevant climate data and download it efficiently into an \R
    session, available for elegant plotting, analysis and/or export. The user is
    required to have an internet connection, and a current CliFlo subscription
    (free) if data from stations other than the public Reefton Ews station is
    sought.
