# Enhancing the National Climate Database with *clifro*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/clifro.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/clifro)

The *clifro* package is designed to minimise the hassle in downloading data from
New Zealand's National Climate Database via [CliFlo](http://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/).
It does this by providing functions for the user to log in, easily choose the 
appropriate datatypes and stations and then query the database. Once the data 
have been downloaded, they are stored as specific objects in **R** with the 
primary aim to ensure data visualisation and exploration is done with minimal 
effort and maximum efficiency.

This package extends the functionality of [CliFlo](http://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/) by
returning stations resulting from simultaneous searches, the ability to 
visualise where these climate stations are by exporting to KML files, and elegant
plotting of the climate data. The vignettes and help files are written with the 
intention that even inexperienced R users can use *clifro* easily. Exporting the 
climate data from **R** is fairly easy and for more experienced useRs, automated 
updating of spreadsheets or databases can be made much easier.

## Free CliFlo Subscription
A current [CliFlo subscription](http://cliflo.niwa.co.nz/pls/niwp/wsubform.intro)
is recommended for *clifro*, otherwise data from only one station is available. 
The subscription is free and lasts for 2 years or 2,000,000 rows without renewal, 
which enables access to around 6,500 climate stations around New Zealand and the 
Pacific.

Note this package requires internet access for connecting to the National 
Climate Database web portal.

# Installation in R

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the latest CRAN release
install.packages("clifro")
library(clifro)
```

# Getting Started
The following small example shows some of the core functionality in *clifro*. 

## Where are the climate stations?
We can search for climate stations anywhere in New Zealand and return the 
station information in the form of a KML file. For example, we can return all 
the climate stations (current and historic) in the greater Auckland region.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
all.auckland.st = cf_find_station("Auckland", search = "region", status = "all")
cf_save_kml(all.auckland.st, "all_auckland_stations")
```

Note the open stations have green markers and the closed stations have red 
markers.

## Download and visualise public climate data

The only station available for unlimited public access to climate data is the
Reefton electronic weather station (EWS). We can download the 2014 wind and rain 
data and easily visualise the results very easily.

```{r, rain-wind-example, echo=-1}
library(clifro)
# Create a public user
public.cfuser = cf_user()

# Choose the datatypes
daily.wind.rain.dt = cf_datatype(c(2, 3), c(1, 1), list(4, 1), c(1, NA))

# Choose the Reefton EWS station
reefton.st = cf_station()

# Send the query to CliFlo and retrieve the data
daily.datalist = cf_query(user = public.cfuser, 
                          datatype = daily.wind.rain.dt, 
                          station = reefton.st,
                          start_date = "2012-01-01 00",
                          end_date = "2013-01-01 00")

# Have a look at what data is now available
daily.datalist

# Plot the data using default plotting methods
plot(daily.datalist)     # For the first dataframe  (Surface Wind)
plot(daily.datalist, 2)  # For the second dataframe (Rain)
```

[technical report](http://stattech.wordpress.fos.auckland.ac.nz/2015-02-new-zealands-climate-data-in-r-an-introduction-to-clifro/) 
for how to use 
*clifro*, including choosing datatypes, stations, saving locations as KML files 
and easy, elegant plotting for various different climate and weather data.
